    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>When I babysat some friendâ€™s kids, their favorite meal were dinosaur chicken nuggets! They inhaled these and loved the fun shape of them. I looked at the ingredients, and even though they were marketed as healthy, there were still some questionable ingredients. I wanted to make my version that were delicious and easy to make but also limited and high quality!</p>
